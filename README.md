This is a repository for practicing github flow

My name is Eric Pomerantz. I am currently working towards a BA in Computer Science. This will be my last semester as I will graduate in December. I am an avid car enthusiast and my day job is repairing electronic control modules for high end european cars such as Porsche and Ferrari. I hope to find a job that will incorporate my love of cars and my programming skills I have learned from school.
